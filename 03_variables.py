# variables: objects containing specific values
x=10
print(x)

y='My name is muhammad Abulhassan'
print(y)


# how to check type of variables

print(type(x))         #this is int type 
print(type(y))         #this is string type

 
# Rules to assign variables
# 1- The variable can be a number,letter or underscores
# 2- Don't start with number
# 3- Spaces are not allowed in programming
# 4- Don't use keywords as they are specific (like true,false,means,median,break,except etc) these are python keyword also available in net
# 5- Python  variables should be short and descriptive
# 6- Case sensitive (this is a case sensitive language so use not always lower case as this is better)
